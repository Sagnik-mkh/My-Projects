			<h1>The Beagle Blog</h1>
			<p>The Beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle
				was developed
				primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking
				instincts, the
				beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs
				in quarantine
				around the world. The beagle is intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a
				lack of inherited
				health problems.
